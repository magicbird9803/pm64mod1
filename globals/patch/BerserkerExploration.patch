%Berserker exploration

%Berserker is checked every frame in battle, but what does it actually do?

%ID = 0x15

%80258598 = line checked every frame for this

%Calls 80266DAC with A0 = mario pointer, A1 = 8
%		calls 	80266D6C against all the sprites?


%802672F8 = secondary check (for the special crouch animation)

%	^ actually 802587CC


%calls 80265D44 with A0 = 0x10

%calls a weird function that returns an animation (00040028 = berserker crouch)
%Stores at 88 + ??? pointer (maybe a mario sprite pointer?)
%Sprite + 88 is current anim



%802A5CC4 = third check (for determining if mario should act autonomously)
