%What if I were to add more world map locations?
%	Ok its probably not going to work but how much work can it be?


%Some data ends up around 800ADE78 persistently
%	wait thats stack stuff
%	Hm map methods are super complicated so it looks like it just uses one big massive function so it ends up being persistent
%	some DMA arguments? and the current text

%Big ol mega function 80125F68
%	Wow it pushes stack pointer a full 150


%802502B8 is start of table	(each entry is 0x14 bytes)

%80250560 = table endpoint?
