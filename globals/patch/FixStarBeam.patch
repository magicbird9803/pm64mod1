%8010F522 = address tracking star beam (1) vs peach beam (2) vs neither (0)
%other values act like 0

%Problem: Star beam dispatches event A ("regular hit") if the target has buffs
%This is bad because if Bowser has attack boosts and you try using star beam to remove star shield, it doesn't work


%80251C34 = a line where event that gets triggered is determined
%ADDIU		S2, R0, A
%-> ADDIU		S2, R0, 13

@Function 180514
{
	NOP
}

%80251C48 = other line where event that gets triggered is determined
%this one is for the attack and defense boosts

@Function 180528
{
	NOP
}

%untested: this stuff might break some special code expecting hit events
%it's probably fine


%Other problem: Peach beam does not remove enemy buffs
%This is also bad because if final bowser has attack boosts then you really want them gone

%Change some checks for 0040 to checks for 00C0 (either 0040 or 0080)
