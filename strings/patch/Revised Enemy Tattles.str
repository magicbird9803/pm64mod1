[Wait][NEXT]When they get hit, they will[BR]
counter attack you.[BR]
This attack doesn't have any[BR]
random timing though...[BR]
[Wait][NEXT]
It's probably a bad idea to try[BR]
spread damage attacks here.[BR]

permanent damage to you, at least[BR]

%I set up the lightning bolts so this tattle is wrong!
%	^	not entirely true, there is only one lightning bolt palette so it gets messed up if you take Watt out at any point
